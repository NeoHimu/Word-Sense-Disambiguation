 mr .  reynolds  also notes that since  british banks  have  no reserve requirements   ,   high  interest  rates  are less likely to curb  inflation  than to cause  recession   .  
 our advice  is  this  : immediately return  the government surpluses  to  the economy  through  incentive-maximizing tax  cuts  ,  and find  some monetary policy target   that  balances  both supply  and  demand  for  money  (  which   neither   aggregates  nor   interest  rates  can do )  .

 it  said  long-term  interest  rates   ,  then above  9 %   ,  could drop to  7 %  by  the end  of  1989   ,  so  bonds   ,   which  benefit from falling  rates   ,  would be  a good buy   .

 because  municipal bonds yields  have risen at  a time  when   interest  rates  generally have fallen  ,   some portfolio managers  are assuming that  bonds  bought now will appreciate in  value  as  the municipal bond market rebounds   .

 the idea  is to have  money  rolling over  each year  at  prevailing  interest  rates   .  
 that  makes  them   a reasonable option  for  investors   who  will accept  some risk  of  price fluctuation  in  order  to make  a bet  that   interest  rates  will decline over  the next year  or so  .

 the yen  ' s softness   ,   she  says  ,  apparently stems from  japanese investors  '   interest   in buying  dollars  against  the yen  to purchase  u . s .  bond issues  and  persistent worries  about  this year  ' s upheaval  in  the japanese government   .

 even though  the currency  is pegged to  the u . s .  dollar   ,  with  a fixed exchange rate  of  hk$ 7 . 8  to  the american currency   ,   the u . s .   and  hong kong economies  do n ' t always move in  lock step   ,  making  it  difficult to predict where   interest  rates  in  the colony  will go  .

 the bonds  will continue to accrue   interest   in  paper  until  the mid-1990s  to late  1990s   .  
 and that  ,  of  course   ,  will depend on just how  high rjr  is forced to fix  the  interest  rate  to get  the bonds  trading up to  par   .

 the fed  allowed  the key federal funds  interest  rate  to dip to about  8 5 %  from  its levels  of just below  9 % last week   .  
 government officials  say  it   ' s unclear  ,  however  ,  where  the bellwether  fed  funds rate   ,   which  influences  other  interest  rates   ,  will come to rest  .  
 for  weeks  prior to  the market  ' s drop   ,   the treasury  had been urging  the fed  to bring down  short-term  interest  rates   ,  and  the fed  had been resisting  .  
 the fed  already is experiencing  political pressure  to supply  lower  interest  rates  and  easy money   .  
 there  is  the constant insistence  that  the fed  could lower   interest  rates  were  it  not so obstinate  .  
 the fed  indeed can lower  short-term  interest  rates  by pumping  reserves  into  the banks   ,  but  it  ca n ' t do much about  them  from there on  .  
 if  the reserves  generate  inflation   ,   which  is  what   the fed fears  most right now  ,    interest  rates  will go up as  lenders  demand  a premium   .

 analysts  say  one point  in  tokyo  ' s favor   this time  is  the fact  that for  the past several weeks   the market  has been in relatively  low gear   ,  driven by  fundamental concerns  about  earnings  and   interest  rates  rather than  wild speculation   .  
 after  the one-point rise oct .  5  to  15 %   ,   britain  ' s base  interest  rate  stands at  its highest level  in  eight years   .  
 a market plunge  in  britain  could bring  pressure  for  him  to lower   interest  rates   .  
  '  '    lockheed  ' s share price  on  the new york stock exchange  has been propped up in  recent weeks   ,  despite  disappointing earnings   ,  because of  mr .  simmons  ' s  interest   in  the company   .  
 the reasons  include  the obvious differences  in  the market  between  this fall  and  1987  :   interest  rates  have n ' t been rising  this time   ,  as  they  were in  1987  ;  the dollar   ,  though hit  friday   ,   has n ' t  been eroding dangerously ;  the economy  is n ' t overheating ; and  ,  above  all   ,   stocks  are far from being as wildly overpriced :  they  are selling at only about  13 times per-share earnings   ,  compared with about  20 two years  ago  .  
 many traders  think  the fed  will quickly lower   interest  rates   ,   a move   that  would be  a plus  for  stocks   .  
 any move  to lower   interest  rates   ,  for  example   ,  would be  a positive  for  stocks   ,  by  making fixed-income investments  less competitive with  them   .  
 in  1987   ,   then-treasury secretary james baker  was threatening  a big drop  in  the dollar  if  west germany  raised   interest  rates   .

 )  but  market observers  point out  that long-term government bond  interest  rates   ,  currently at  7 . 85 %   ,  are  2 . 5 percentage points  lower than  the level   that  prevailed in  october 1987   ,  when  *interest rates  had been rising for most of  the year   .

 )  citibank  ' s confidence  was bolstered as recently as  10 days  ago when  representatives  of  120 banks   that  had expressed   interest   in  the ual transaction  attended  a meeting  with  citibank representatives   .

 many analysts  also suspect that  the federal reserve  has begun to reduce   interest  rates  and could go further  .  
 lower  interest  rates  usually diminish  a currency  ' s appeal  to  international investors  and  speculators   .  
 traders  concluded that  u . s .   interest  rates  would remain  firm   ,  and  the dollar  quickly climbed to  its intraday highs  of  1 . 9140 marks  and  144 . 80 yen   .  
  '  '   in  the past week  and  a half   ,   major european countries  -- led by  west germany  and  japan  -- raised  official domestic  interest  rates   ,  mostly to keep  their currencies  from falling further and to stem  the inflationary impact  of  those declines   .

 september  ' s steep rise  in  producer prices  shows  that inflation  still persists  ,  and  the pessimism  over   interest  rates  caused by  the new price data  contributed to  the stock market  ' s plunge friday   .

 that  makes  the total open  interest   in  copper futures  and  options  equal to  378 , 326 tons   .  
 the wide disparity  between  open  interest   and  deliverable supplies  is n ' t as great as  the numbers  suggest because  the vast majority  of  futures contracts  are simply nullified by offsetting  trades  and  most option contracts  typically expire  unexercised   .

 the pound  ' s relentless slide  stirred  the bank  of  england  to mount  a global-market intervention  and may soon force  british chancellor  of  the exchequer nigel lawson  to push through  another increase  in  british  interest  rates  --  the 11th  since  june 1988   .  
 behind  the turmoil  is  an expected decision today  by  the west german bundesbank  to boost  key  interest  rates   .  
 if  the bank  of  england  ' s market interventions  do n ' t shore up  the relative value  of  sterling   ,  ``  the only thing   he    ' s  got left is   interest  rates   ,   '  '  said  shearson lehman hutton analyst adam bennett   .

 this  means that  the current domestic deficit  must be financed with  bonds   ,   which  of  course  become readily marketable in  moscow   ,   leningrad   ,   new york  and  london  if  the bonds  carry  the promise  to pay  principal  and   interest   in  gold   .
